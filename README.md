# Demo App



## How to Run the App

1. **Install dependencies**

   - Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
   - Run:
     ```sh
     npm install
     ```

2. **Start the Mock API Server**

   - Run:
     ```sh
     node mock-api-server.js
     ```

3. **Start the React App**
   - In a separate terminal, run:
     ```sh
     npm run dev
     ```

This will launch the dashboard and connect it to the mock API server.
